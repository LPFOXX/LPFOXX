### Hello there, I'm Lidneu

I am a software engineer commited to learning and applying the best practices of software development to overcome eveergrowing sofware engineering challenges.

I am passionate coding and programming in general. I have a deep interest in computer graphics and the maths that support it.
I also perform well in fullstack web development and lately I am being drawn towards embedded architectures. 

I’m currently working on a game engine written in C++ so I can create my own games later. I’m currently learning C#, .NET framework and (micro)processor architecture.

⚡ Fun fact: Are there any easter eggs in my repositories?
