### Hello there, I'm Lidneu


I am a software engineer commited to learning and applying the best practices of software development to overcome evergrowing sofware engineering challenges. I am an avid learner and occasional teacher.

I am passionate about coding and programming in general. I have a deep interest in computer graphics and the maths that support it.
I also perform well in fullstack web development and lately I am being drawn towards embedded architectures. 

I’m currently working on a game engine written in C++ so I can create my own games later. I’m currently learning C#, .NET framework and (micro)processor architecture.
